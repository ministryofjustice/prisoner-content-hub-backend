# Kubernetes health check

The file `docroot/health/index.html` is used as the k8ns liveness/readiness check.

It's intended to be as simple as possible, we only want to report that Apache is able to respond.
We do not want to also report on external services (such as RDS).
We therefore avoid a Drupal bootstrap.
