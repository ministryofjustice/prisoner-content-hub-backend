# Prisoner Hub Taxonomy Sorting

The purpose of this module is to provide an admin page that allows content editors to
fix sorting issues on Taxonomy pages.

These pages are only supposed to be temporary, until the content sorting issues have
been fixed.  But there is also a chance the page could become a permanent feature.
